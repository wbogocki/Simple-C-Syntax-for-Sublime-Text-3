# Simple C Syntax for Sublime Text 3

Merry Christmas!

## What?

1. Is simple
2. Is short & modifiable
3. Is limited to the part of C that is possible to correctly implement in Sublime
4. Is bug-free
> Enough to not make me angry - unlike Sublime's implementation ðŸ’¢ðŸ’¢ðŸ’¢
5. Is not the >1000 lines monstrosity that ships with Sublime and can't even colour C

## Why?

1. Sublime's built-in C syntax is bugged
2. Sublime's syntax colouring mechanism is insufficient to implement C
> Wishes to Sublime Santa: Please make it possible to arbitraily parse and colour text!
