# Simple C Syntax for Sublime Text 3

Merry Christmas!

## What?

1. Is simple
2. Is short & modifiable (~150 lines)
3. Is basic
4. Is bugless (as much as possible and not sure about float literals)
5. Is done in one day and only lightly tested
6. Is not the >1000 lines monstrosity that ships with Sublime that can't even properly colour C

## Why?

1. Sublime's built-in C syntax is bugged
2. Sublime's syntax colouring mechanism is really bad
> Wishes to Santa: Please replace it with a loadable script or DLL so I can arbitrarily colour my files!
3. Sublime's rest is really good
