# Simple C Syntax for Sublime Text 3

Merry Christmas!

## This is a C syntax definition for Sublime Text 3 that:

1. Is simple, short & readable
2. Is limited to the part of C that is possible to sanely implement in Sublime
3. Is not the >1000 lines monstrosity that ships with Sublime and can't even colour C ğŸ’¢ğŸ’¢ğŸ’¢
